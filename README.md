# Crispy Takoyaki - Your New Tech Hangout! 🐙💻<br/><br/>
This full-stack app was created using Node, Express, Sequelize, and Handlebars. It was created using <i>Object-Oriented Programming</i> and <i>Model-View-Controller</i> programming paradigms. Crispy Takoyaki is a tech blog where engineers can create posts, comment on others' posts, and upvote posts. It's easy to create a login for Crispy Takoyaki, and you'll be able to come back again and again to share ideas, big and small, with other developers. <br/><br/>
Live, deployed Heroku link: [coming soon!]
