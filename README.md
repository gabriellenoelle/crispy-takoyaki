# Crispy Takoyaki - Your New Tech Hangout! 🐙💻<br/><br/>
This app was created using Node, Express, Sequelize, and Handlebars. Crispy Takoyaki is a CRM-style blog where engineers can create posts, comment on others' posts, and upvote posts. It's easy to create a login for Crispy Takoyaki, and you'll be able to come back again and again to share ideas, big and small, with other developers. <br/><br/>
Live, deployed Heroku link: [coming soon!]
